<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About MonkeyBot

MonkeyBot is a general purpose Discord Bot that was created for the needs of the [Monkey Gamers](https://www.monkey-gamers.com) community. Its main functions are:
* Welcoming new users
* Get updates from various feeds (ATOM/RSS)
* (Self) role assignments
* Scheduled announcements
* Game server tracking
* Stream announcements
* Handling of applicants (planned)
* Silly stuff like Picture search, Trivia, Chuck Norris jokes, Benzen Facts, xkcd...

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started


### Prerequisites

* Latest .NET SDK for your platform (5.0 or later) - you can download it [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
* A registered Discord application with a bot access token. If you don't have one, you can create one with your existing Discord account [here](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/). There you have to add a Bot and need to copy both **Bot Token** and **Client ID**. To then add the bot to your Discord server go to `https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?scope=bot&permissions=0&client_id=[ID]`, replacing *[ID]* with the **Client ID** of your bot (not the token)
* Optional: An IDE of your choice (Visual Studio 2019 recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MarkusKgit/MonkeyBot.git   
   ```
   or download it from GitHub and unzip it
2. Pick the right branch
   The latest stable version is on the main branch:
   `git checkout main`
   If you want to try the latest development build then check out the development branch:
   `git checkout develop`
3. Build

   ```sh
   cd MonkeyBot
   dotnet build
   ```
   or open the solution in Visual Studio and build

4. Run

   ```sh   
   dotnet run
   ```

   On the first run of the Bot the configuration file will automatically be created by prompts on the command line. For a first test you only need to provide the Bot access token. The configuration will be stored in `/config/configuration.json`. Look at [exampleconfig.json](exampleconfig.json) to see the structure of the config file if you wish to create it manually.

5. Publish 

   To permanently run the bot you should publish it first:
   ```sh
   dotnet publish -c Release --output published
   ```
   Then you can create a daemon/service that automatically runs `dotnet published/MonkeyBot.dll`
   Here is an example for a system.d config file (tested on Ubuntu server):
   ```sh
    # /etc/systemd/system/MonkeyBot.service
    # To enable: sudo systemctl enable MonkeyBot.service
    # To start: sudo systemctl start MonkeyBot.service
    
    [Unit]
    Description=MonkeyBot service
  
    [Service]
    WorkingDirectory=/home/markus/MonkeyBot/published
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/dotnet /home/markus/MonkeyBot/published/MonkeyBot.dll
    Restart=on-failure
    RestartSec=10
    SyslogIdentifier=monkeybot-service
  
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```
   Updates to new versions are then as easy as:
   ```sh
   sudo systemctl stop MonkeyBot.service
   cd /home/markus/MonkeyBot
   git pull
   dotnet publish -c Release --output published
   sudo systemctl start MonkeyBot.service
   ```

## Usage

Once the bot is running and connected it will respond to [commands](Commands.md). 
Try !help to get you started.


## Troubleshooting

Logfiles are stored in `Logs` directory and fatal errors will also appear in the command line output. The SQLite database is located in the `Data` directory.
If you have any questions or found a bug you can open an [issue](https://github.com/MarkusKgit/MonkeyBot/issues) or get in touch on [Discord][discord-url]
